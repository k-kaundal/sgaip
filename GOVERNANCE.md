# SGAIP Governance

SGAIP is an open, protocol-level specification.

- No single entity owns the protocol
- No tokens or monetization mechanisms are defined
- All contributions are reviewed publicly
- Decisions are made by technical consensus

This repository exists to define and maintain a neutral, long-lived standard.
