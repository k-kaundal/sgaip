# SGAIP

**Stateless Global Agent Identity Protocol (SGAIP)** is a protocol for global, offline-verifiable identity
for humans and AI agents.

SGAIP defines identity as a **cryptographic proof**, not a registry entry, ledger record,
or platform account.

## Key Properties

- Stateless (no registry, no ledger)
- Offline verifiable
- Permissionless
- AI-native

- ❌ Not a registry
- ❌ Not a token system
- ❌ Not a platform or service
